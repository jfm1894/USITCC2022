# USITCC2022
<h1>Practicing implementing the solution from last years USITCC app development competition</h1>
<ul>To do</ul>
<li>fix bug with incorrectly handling normal user wrong password</li>
<li>remove json data and handling and switch to access db</li>
<li>implement buttons on AppForm that handle sorting/searching (i think a binding navigator is ideal here)</li>
<li>add correct view per user, regular users should only have access to their data</li>
<li>add some polish to the program</li>
<li>i would like to change how users are authenticated, i think theres a better way of doing it</li>
